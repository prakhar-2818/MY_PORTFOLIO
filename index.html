    <h1 id="headabout"><u>ABOUT ME :</u></h1>
    <p id="headcontent">Hi, I’m Prakhar Shakya, a dedicated and enthusiastic Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT) student at KIET Group of Institutions, Ghaziabad (Batch 2024–2028). I’m deeply passionate about technology and aim to become a skilled software engineer, with a special focus on Java-based development.

I have a strong interest in backend programming, object-oriented design, and building scalable applications. Java is the core language I’m focusing on, and I enjoy learning how to use it to develop efficient, real-world software solutions. I also explore other technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase, and basic IoT systems to broaden my understanding of how software interacts across platforms.

My learning approach is hands-on—I love building mini projects, exploring frameworks like Spring Boot, and solving logical problems to improve my coding skills. I’m also open to collaborating on group projects, attending hackathons, and contributing to open-source communities to grow as a developer.

In the future, I aspire to work in a tech company where I can contribute to backend systems, enterprise applications, or full-stack projects using Java. I'm always eager to explore new technologies and stay updated with industry trends to shape my career in software engineering.</p>
